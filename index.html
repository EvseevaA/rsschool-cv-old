            <p>
            I studied to be a programmer, after college, I worked as a
            choreographer, after which I received a job offer in the Belarusian
            Dance League, where I worked for about 10 years.
            </p>
            <p>
            I started to take EPAM courses to train a functional testing engineer
            (I interrupted her studies due to a move and a change of plans).
            </p>
            <p>
            I have been designing Internet resources for a long time, but I have
            been professionally doing this since 2021. I have always been
            interested in and continue to follow the trends in design. I
            constantly improve my skills and take additional courses to raise my
            professional level. In addition to UX/UI and identity, I plan to skill
            up in the direction of Motion design.
            </p>

            Responsible, executive, sociable, not afraid of criticism, always
            ready to help.
