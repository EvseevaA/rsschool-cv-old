####ABOUT ME
I studied to be a programmer, after college, I worked as a choreographer, after which I received a job offer in the Belarusian Dance League, where I worked for about 10 years.
I started to take EPAM courses to train a functional testing engineer (I interrupted her studies due to a move and a change of plans).
I have been designing Internet resources for a long time, but I have been professionally doing this since 2021. I have always been interested in and continue to follow the trends in design. I constantly improve my skills and take additional courses to raise my professional level. In addition to UX/UI and identity, I plan to skill up in the direction of Motion design.
Responsible, executive, sociable, not afraid of criticism, always ready to help.
